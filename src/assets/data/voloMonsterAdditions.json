Through dark magic, these components take on an enormous and vile humanoid shape, resembling a bipedal toad. In this form, a banderhobb temporarily serves its creator as a thug, a thief, and a kidnapper. Birthed by Hags. In the earliest days of the world, a coven of night hags devised a ritual that led to the ation of the first banderhobb. A hag that knows the ritual might be willing to teach it for the right price. Some other dark fey and powerful fiends also know of the cess, as do a few mortal mages. Instructions might also be found in a tome devoted to debased wizardry. Silent and Deadly. When the ritual to create a hobb is complete, flesh, spirit, and shadow combine to produce a creature as big as an ogre. The newly formed monstrosity has spindly limbs that belie great strength. Its broad maw holds a long tongue and rows of fangs, both of which it uses to grab and swallow a creature or perhaps an object the banderhobb intends to steal. spite its size, a banderhobb makes little noise, moving as silently as the shadows that infuse it. A banderhobb isn't capable of speech, but it can understand orders given to it by its creator and communicates with nearby hobbs in a psychic manner. Asents of Evil. During its brief existence, a hobb attempts to carry out the bidding of the one who birthed it. It accomplishes its mission with no concern for the harm it suffers or creates. Its only desire is to serve and succeed. A banderhobb that is assigned to track down a target is particularly dangerous when it is provided with a lock of hair, a personal belonging, or other object connected to the target. Possession of such an item allows it to sense the creature's location from as far as a mile away. A banderhobb fulfills its duties until its existence ends. When it expires, usually several days after its birth, it leaves behind only tarry goo and wisps of shadow. ends tell of a dark tower in the Shadowfell where the shadows sometimes reform, and banderhobbs roam. 6£< ¥· Mt!

The General provided yugoloths that died to serve the cause of the goblin god. Yet when the time came to honor his part of the compact, Maglubiyet reneged on the deal. As an act of vengeance, the General of Gehenna ated the soul-devouring ests to devour goblinoid souls and deprive Maglubiyet of troops for his army in the afterlife. Consumers of Sauls. A barghest is born to goblin parents just as normal offspring are. The creature emerges in the form of a goblin, then develops the ability to assume its true form: that of a large, fiendish canine. The mission of every barghest, implanted in it by the General of Gehenna, is to consume seventeen goblinoid souls by devouring the bodies of those it kills. Souls consumed in this way are prevented from joining biyet's forces in Acheron. Why seventeen? Because the oaths Maglubiyet broke in his compact with the General totaled seventeen. A barghest hungers for the day when it can complete its mission, return to Gehenna, and serve the Gen-eral directly in his yugoloth legions, but it doesn't kill goblinoids indiscriminately. By devouring the souls of goblinoid leaders and other powerful individuals, rather than lowly goblins, a barghest earns elevated status in the afterlife. Barghests typically keep their true nature secret, preying upon a goblin or two when the nity arises, until they reach adult age and are old and strong enough to seek out stronger prey. When goblins discover that a barghest is among them, they react with groveling obeisance, each member of the tribe eager to show the barghest that it isn't worthy of being devoured. Banished by Fire. A barghest avoids contact with large, open fires. Any conflagration larger than its body acts as a gateway to Gehenna and banishes the fiend to that plane, where it is likely to be slain or enslaved by a yugoloth for its failure. \nSOUL FEEDING A barghest can feed on the corpse of a humanoid that it killed that has been dead for less than 10 minutes, de· vouring both flesh and soul in doing so. This feeding takes at least 1 minute, and it destroys the victim's body. The victim's soul is trapped in the barghest for 24 hours, after which time it is digested. If the barghest dies before the soul is digested, the soul is released. While a humanoid's soul is trapped in a barghest, any form of revival that could work has only a 50 percent chance of doing so, freeing the soul from the barghest ifit is successful. Once a creature's soul is digested, however, no mortal magic can return that humanoid to life. ",

        "flavorText": "I t BEHOLDERS True beholders are isolationists that despise others of their kind, but \ntheir dreams can give rise to a variety of lesser beholder-like creatures, a few of which are scribed here. DEATH Kiss A death kiss is a lesser beholder that might come into being when a beholder has a vivid nightmare about losing blood. Instead of magical eye rays, it has ten long tentacles, each ending in a mouth full of teeth. In coloration and shape it is similar to the beholder that dreamed it into existence, but its hue is more muted. Blood Drinker. A death kiss survives solely on gested blood, which it uses to generate electrical energy inside its body. Paranoid about dying from starvation, it obsessively drains even little creatures such as rats in an effort to stave off this fate for as long as possible. After it drains its prey, it abandons the corpse to engers. A death kiss prefers to hunt alone. If it meets another death kiss, it might fight, flee, or team up, pending on its health and pride. When underground, it uses its tentacles as feelers, prodding and examining the environment in all directions. Above ground, it ally keeps its tentacles retracted when on the hunt, then lashes out and extends them to their full length to catch opponents off guard. False Tyrant. In poor lighting and with its tentacles extended, a death kiss can be mistaken for a true holder. It \nmight purposely present itself as a beholder to an ignorant creature, but this behavior is rare, since it usually is focused on hunting and lacks the portance and paranoia of a true beholder. It can speak through any of its tentacle-throats, and its voice sounds nasal and high-pitched. A true beholder has little to fear DEATH Kiss \n",

Thus, out of self-preservation, a death kiss ally submits to the rule of a beholder that it encounters, though it might attempt to escape as soon as its master is preoccupied. \nSimple Tactics. A death kiss lacks the combat finesse and intelligence of a beholder. It might attempt an unusual maneuver to control its prey (such as flying up while grappling), but in most cases, it attaches one or more of its tentacles to a creature and drains blood until its prey collapses. If it is in a superior position and its opponent poses no threat, it might toy with its food, slowly squeezing and draining the life out of a creature. GAUTH A gauth is a hungry, tyrannical beholder-like creature that eats magic and tries to exact tribute from anything weaker than itself. Its body is about 4 feet in diameter, with six eyestalks, a central eye (sometimes surrounded by multiple smaller eyes), and four small grasping tacles near its mouth. It has color and texture variations similar to a true beholder. Magical Metabolism. A gauth can survive on meat but prefers to sustain itself with power drained from magic objects. If starved of magic for several weeks, it is forced back to its home plane, so it constantly seeks new items to drain. A gauth might employ creatures to serve it by bringing it items that provide it with sustenance. Accidental Summoning. When the ritual to sum-mon a spectator goes wrong, a gauth might push itself through the flawed connection, arriving immediately or several minutes later. It might present itself as a holder to ignorant creatures in an attempt to intimidate them, or as a spectator to its summoner in order to drain magic items it is expected to guard.

A beholder usually drives away or kills any gauths that enter its territory, but it might choose to enslave them and use them as lieutenants. Gauths are less xenophobic than beholders, so they might form small clusters and work together, though they're just as likely to ignore each other entirely. GAZER A gazer is \na tiny manifestation of a beholder's dreams. It resembles the beholder who dreamed it into existence, but its body is only 8 inches wide, and it has only four eyestalks. It follows its creator like a devoted, aggressive puppy, and sometimes small packs of these creatures patrol their master's lair for vermin to kill and lone tures to harass. Nuisance Pet. A gazer can't speak any languages but can approximate mimicking words and sentences in a high-pitched, mocking manner. Beholders find gazers amusing and tolerate their presence like spoiled pets. A gazer can't be tamed by anyone but its creator, except through the use of magic or by bonding with a caster (see sidebar). Some beholders with wizard ions insist they take a gazer as a familiar because they can see through the eyes of these creatures. AUressive Vermin-Eater. A wild gazer (one living separately from a beholder) is territorial, eats bugs and small animals, and is known for playing with its food. A lone gazer avoids picking fights with creatures that are Medium or larger, but a pack of them might take on larger prey. A gazer might follow humanoids in its territory, noisily mimicking their speech and generally being a nuisance, until they leave the area, but it flees if confronted by something it can't kill. VARI.ANT! C.AZER FAMILIAR Spellcasters who are interested in unusual familiars find that gazers are eager to serve someone who has magical power, especially those who make a point of bullying and harassing others. The gazer behaves aggressively toward creatures smaller than itself, and it tends to randomly tack house pets, farm animals, and even children in town unless its master is very strict. A gazer serving as a familiar has the following trait. · Familiar. The gazer can serve another creature as a fa. miliar, forming a telepathic bond \nwith its willing master, provided that the mater is at least a 3rd-level spellcaster. While the two are bonded, the master can sense what the ga2!er senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. If its master causes it physical harm, the gazer will end its service as a familiar, breaking the telepathic bond. GAZER ",

A worshiper of Orcus can take ritual vows while carving the demon lord's symbol on its chest over the heart. Orcus's power flays body, mind, and soul, leaving behind a sentient husk that sucks in all life energy near it. Most bodaks come into being in this way, then unleashed to spread death in Orcus's name. Orcus created the first bodaks in the Abyss from seven devotees, called the Hierophants of Annihilation. These figures, as mighty as balors, have free will but serve the Prince of Undeath directly. Any one of these bodaks can turn a slain mortal into a bodak with its gaze. Like each Hierophant of Annihilation, every bodak bears the mark of Orcus as a chest wound, an opening where a mortal humanoid's heart would be. Orcus can recall anything a bodak sees or hears. If he so chooses, he can speak through a bodak to address his enemies and followers directly. Bodaks are sions of Orcus's will outside the Abyss, serving the mon prince's aims and other minions. Unhallowed Fragments. A bodak retains vague impressions of its past life. It seeks out both its former allies and its former enemies to destroy them, as its warped soul seeks to erase anything connected to its former life. Minions of Orcus are the one exception to this compulsion; a bodak recognizes them as kindred souls and spares them from its wrath. Anyone who knew the individual before its transformation into a dak can recognize mannerisms or other subtle clues to its original identity. Even nature despises bodaks. The sun burns away a bodak's tainted flesh. The creature's gaze lays waste to the living. Anyone a bodak slays with its gaze withers, its face frozen in a mask of terror. The monster's mere presence is so unnatural that it chills the soul. Animals untrained for war instinctively flee just before a bo-dak arrives. Ravaged Saul. The soul of a creature that becomes a bodak is so damaged that it is unfit for most forms of magical resurrection. Only a wish spell or similar magic can return a bodak to its former life.

They lurk in the fringes of the Feywild and are also found on the terial Plane, where they hide under beds and in closets, waiting to frighten and bedevil folk with their mischief. A boggle is born out of feelings of loneliness, alizing in a place where the Feywild touches the world in proximity to an intelligent being that feels isolated or abandoned. For example, a forsaken child might tentionally conjure a boggle and see it as a sort of inary friend. A boggle might also appear in the attic of a lonely widower's house or in the caves of a hermit. Irksome Pests. Boggles engage in petty pranks to amuse themselves, passing the time at their hosts' expense. A boggle isn't above breaking dishes, hiding tools, making frightening sounds to startle cows and sour their milk, or hiding a baby in an attic. Although a boggle's antics might cause distress and unintentional harm, mischief-not mayhem-is usually its intent. If threatened, a boggle flees rather than stand and fight. Oily Excretions. A boggle excretes an oil from its pores and can make its oil slippery or sticky. The oil dries up and disappears an hour later. Twisting Space. A boggle can create magical ings to travel short distances or to pilfer items that would otherwise be beyond its reach. To create such a rift in space, a boggle must be adjacent to a space fined by a frame, such as an open window or a doorway, a gap between the bars of a cage, or the opening tween the feet of a bed and the floor. The rift is invisible and disappears after a few seconds-enough time for the boggle to step, reach, or ~attack through it. Unreliable Allies. A boggle makes a decent servant for a strong-willed master, and wicked creatures such as fomorians and hags sometimes shelter boggles in their lairs. Warlocks who form pacts with archfey have also been known to command boggles, and charismatic viduals who make the right offers have enjoyed rary alliances with these little tricksters.

        "flavorText": "CATOBLEPAS The catoblepas is as loathsome as the vile swamplands in which it lives. Like such wastelands, this tion of bloated buffalo, dinosaur, warthog, and amus parts has few redeeming qualities. Few travelers willingly traverse the territory of a ,catoblepas. Animalistic Nature. Despite their ungainly ogy, ca.toblepases resemble natural beasts. A catoblepas behaves much like an animal, too, ambling through its marshy home, munching choice vegetation, eating the occasional bit of carrion, and wallowing in mire. A blepas might be found with the one mate it chooses for life and, on occasion, a calf. Especially if it's guarding its young, a catoblepas attacks anyone that moves too close. Stench of Death. A catoblepas's stink, like that of death mixed with swamp gas and skunk musk, gives it away as being much more ghastly than its appearance suggests. When it is on the attack, a catoblepas reveals the extent of its horrific nature. The creature's tine neck has trouble lifting its head, but one glare from its bloodshot eyes can rot flesh. At the end of its tail is a club that can rattle body and soul if it strikes true, ing a victim unable to act. If the target of its attacks dies, the catoblepas feasts on the fresh remains. Blighted Territory. A catoblepas's nature as a ture of disease and decay brings out similar istics in the creature's swampy habitat. Such a wetland becomes gloomy, tangled, and more fetid than it was before. Beneficial qualities of the environment, such as healing herbs and clean water, diminish when a toblepas lives nearby. Swamp gases have a hint of the catoblepas's foulness to them. Animals in the area are more aggressive and liable to be diseased. Degenerate creatures are likely to take up residence near a blepas's territory, as are those seeking to avoid notice. Sinister Folklore. Ordinary folk rarely see a blepas, but the creature has such a feared reputation that stories about it are ingrained in the popular culture. Any rumor of a catoblepas taking up residence nearby is taken to be a bad omen, even if the rumor is proven false. The silhouette of a catoblepas, with its tail tended over its body and its head held low, is a baleful heraldic figure signifying death or doom. Sages say that gods of pestilence and rot created blepases as embodiments of their influence. Whatever the origin of the creature, stories link the catoblepas to misfortune, and many of these yarns have elements of truth. Some such tales claim that hags tend blepases like cattle, and that a swamp that contains a catoblepas might also be home to a hag that drinks the monster's milk. Although a particular catoblepas might not be linked to a hag, a coven of hags might keep one or more of these beasts as guardians or pets. Other legends say that those of impure heart can tame a blepas. Indeed, some tales have circulated of malevolent warlocks and dark knights who have discovered how to domesticate the beasts and use them as mounts. ",

        "flavorText": "CAVE FISHER A cave fisher is a subterranean arachnid with a long snout that houses spinnerets, enabling the creature to produce sticky filament, much like the strands of a der's webbing, which the creature uses to snag prey. Ambushers. A cave fisher usually hunts small mals and is fond of bats, so it stretches its filament over an opening that such prey might travel through. It then climbs to a hiding spot and adheres itself to the surface to rest and wait. When prey blunders into the filament, the cave fisher reels in its meal. A group of cave fishers might work together to cover a large area with filaments, but as soon as one captures potential food, every cave fisher in the area competes for the prize. If a victim capes from the initial ambush, a cave fisher can reclaim its prey by shooting a filament out to capture it again. Mavin; Up in the World. Scarce food might draw a group of cave fishers up to the surface, into a shadowy canyon or a gloomy forest that features both native imal prey and creatures such as explorers or travelers occasionally moving through the area. A cave fisher instinctively knows that larger targets such as humanoids are more difficult to overcome, so the creatures shy away from attacking such prey unless they come across a solitary target. They might try to pick off a scout moving ahead of a group of travelers or a straggler lagging behind, rather than attracting the attention of the entire group. Valuable Innards. Nearly every part of a cave fisher is useful after the creature has been dispatched. Its blood is alcoholic and tastes like strong liquor. Several dwar-ven spirits include cave fisher blood as part of the ipe, and some dwarves, especially berserkers, drink the blood straight. If they are gathered after being extruded, cave fisher filaments can be woven into rope that is thin, tough, and nearly invisible. Cave fisher meat is edible, tasting much like crab cooked in strong wine. The ture's shell is used in the manufacture of tools, armor, and jewelry. Reluctant Servants. While some folk hunt cave fishers to kill them for their filaments and their blood, others capture cave fisher eggs and rear the hatchlings. Cave fishers have a natural aversion to fire, since their blood is flammable. As such, chitines and hobgoblins sometimes use the threat of fire to train cave fishers then employ them to guard passages or as beasts of ~ar. CAVE FISHER ",

They operate in well-organized colonies that prove to be effective fighters in the war against the enemies of the Demon Queen of Spiders. On occasion, Lolth pits chitines against dark elves-even though both groups worship her-as a way of punishing the drow, who created the chitines but displeased their dess by doing so. Unnatural Orisin. Long ago, the drow first subjected elf prisoners to horrible rituals that transformed the captives into creatures with both manoid and spider traits, which their creators dubbed cbitines. The dark elves' intention was to create slaves dedicated first of all to the drow and, by association with them, to Lolth. As the drow ultimately discovered, the goddess found this arrangement unacceptable. The creation process required cooperation between magical disciplines. Drow wizards and warlocks used arcane magic and demonic powers, and drow esses invoked Lolth's aid for the divine spark needed to ensure the subject's survival. Lolth watched, expecting at some part of the process to see these new abominations dedicated to her, but no such ritqal was performed. In retribution for this lack of respect, the Spider Queen twisted the drow's creation rituals to serve her own purposes. Lolth's Revenge. As the drow continued to perform the rituals, the process usually transformed the subject into the spindly, stunted creature they expected. sionally, though, the elf changed into a monstrosity that was more spider than elf, resembling Lolth in her spider form, and more cunning than a chitine, that the drow dubbed a choldrith. At first, the drow were unaware that the new tures were signs of Lolth's displeasure with them. Instead, they were pleased, because choldriths could lay eggs that birthed more chitines (and the rare drith) and could direct the chitines in their work. But the dark elves came to realize their mistake-choldriths belonged to Lolth, body and soul. They whispered to the chitines of their adoration of the Spider Queen and their enmity of the drow, and the seeds of a rebellion took root and grew. The chitines and choldriths rose up against their would-be masters; soon afterward most of the creatures were free, and a number of the drow who helped breed and tend them were dead. Nowadays, drow still create chitines when they have need to. Outside the presence of a choldrith, chitines make good workers for the drow, and they can be useful if the drow find an independent chitine colony and want to infiltrate it. If the creation process yields a choldrith, though, the drow destroy the creature immediately. Lolth's Chosen. Choldriths are born with a ical devotion to Lolth, which leads them to develop some skill in divine magic. They preach that chitines are Lolth's favored people, and that choldriths are the Spider Queen's rightful worldly representatives sent to CHITINE ",

Choldriths also believe and teach that Lolth's spider form, much like that of a drith, is her truest shape. Any idol to Lolth in a chitine colony depicts Lolth in this way. As servants of Lolth, choldriths and chitines love spiders and spiderlike creatures. They rear spiders and similar arachnids, such as cave fishers. Chitine colonies erect shrines to Lolth that serve as beacons, attracting spiders and other evil, brutish beings that serve her.

Chitines and choldriths ble spiders, but they behave more like social insects such as ants. Chitines are divided into worker and rior castes, and choldriths occupy the top levels of a ony's hierarchy. Each chitine has a social position that comes with duties related to that rank, and all chitines are expected to willingly sacrifice themselves to protect the choldriths. Every chitine has spinnerets and slowly produces webbing that is used to build floors, walls, structures, objects, and traps that benefit and protect the colony. A warrior might be responsible for crafting web armor (which is as tough as hide or leather), while a group of workers might be tasked to dig a pit trap and cover it with fragile webbing disguised with loose dirt to appear as a solid surface. A colony can support numerous choldriths, which serve as commanders, priests, and supervisors. The choldriths continually jockey for position, although they rarely confront one another in a way that puts the ony at risk. The colony is ruled by a singular sovereign that determines which colony members perform which tasks, including whether she or any other choldrith is permitted to lay eggs. If this supreme ruler receives a vision from Lolth, she might change her colony's entire course of action.

        "flavorText": "DARKLINGS Ancient legends speak of a seelie fey who betrayed the Summer Queen. His true name has been stricken from history, but the stories call him Dubh Catha (\"Dark Crow\" in Common). So great was the Summer Queen's wrath that she cursed every member of his house. Other fey refer to the descendants of Dubh Catha's house as the dubh sith~or, in Common, \"darklings.\" Darklings most often settle in secluded caverns and chambers beneath the towns of other species. From such enclaves, they quietly ply their trade as thieves and assassins. The Killing Light. The Summer Queen's curse causes a darkling's body to absorb light, and doing so wizens the creature, much like the effect of rapid aging. For this reason, darklings cover every part of their body with clothing when exposure to light is a risk. The light a darkling absorbs over the course of its lifetime explodes outward when the darkling dies, incinerating the ture and much of its possessions. Love of Art. Despite their curse, darklings retain a fondness for the beauty of art. A darkling might risk taking a peek at a sunset or lighting a tiny candle to glimpse the colors in a painting or a jewel. Elder Transformation. A wise and respected darkling can qualify to undergo a ritual to become an elder. Other elders mark the supplicant with glowing tattoos, neling some of the darkling's absorbed light away from its body. If the ritual succeeds, the darkling grows into a tall and fair form, like that of a gray-skinned elf. The darkling perishes if the ritual fails.

        "flavorText": "\nDARKLINGS Ancient legends speak of a seelie fey who betrayed the Summer Queen. His true name has been stricken from history, but the stories call him Dubh Catha (\"Dark Crow\" in Common). So great was the Summer Queen's wrath that she cursed every member of his house. Other fey refer to the descendants of Dubh Catha's house as the dubh sith~or, in Common, \"darklings.\" Darklings most often settle in secluded caverns and chambers beneath the towns of other species. From such enclaves, they quietly ply their trade as thieves and assassins. The Killing Light. The Summer Queen's curse causes a darkling's body to absorb light, and doing so wizens the creature, much like the effect of rapid aging. For this reason, darklings cover every part of their body with clothing when exposure to light is a risk. The light a darkling absorbs over the course of its lifetime explodes outward when the darkling dies, incinerating the ture and much of its possessions. Love of Art. Despite their curse, darklings retain a fondness for the beauty of art. A darkling might risk taking a peek at a sunset or lighting a tiny candle to glimpse the colors in a painting or a jewel. Elder Transformation. A wise and respected darkling can qualify to undergo a ritual to become an elder. Other elders mark the supplicant with glowing tattoos, neling some of the darkling's absorbed light away from its body. If the ritual succeeds, the darkling grows into a tall and fair form, like that of a gray-skinned elf. The darkling perishes if the ritual fails.

Sometimes a deep scion returns to its former home and a hero's welcome-unexpectedly found alive when all hope was lost. At other times the deep scion takes on a new identity. In any case, it is the deep scion's duty to infiltrate the air-breathing world and report back to its master. When set to its task, a deep scion worms its way into the life of an ing enemy as a new best friend, an irresistible lover, the perfect candidate for a job, or in some other role that ables the minion to carry out its master's commands. t Cold-Hearted Killers. The training to which a deep scion is subjected rids it of empathy for those whom it spies on. Though one might behave as though ated, laugh at the joke of a friend, or appear incensed at some injustice, each of these acts is artificial to the deep scion, a means to an end. It believes that its true form is the shape it takes when it returns to the sea that it thinks of as home. Ironically, however, a deep scion that is killed when in its piscine form is stripped of the magic that robbed it of emotion, leaving behind the corpse of the person the deep scion once was.

        "flavorText": "DEMONS Demon lords create lesser demons for the purpose of spreading chaos and terror throughout the multiverse. Three such demons are described here. BABAU Demons and devils clash endlessly for control of the Lower Planes. One of these battles pitted the legions of the archdevil Glasya against the screaming hordes of the demon lord Graz'zt. It is said that Glasya wounded Graz'zt with her sword, and the first babaus arose where his blood struck the ground. Their sudden appearance helped rout Glasya and secured Graz'zt's place as one of the preeminent demon lords of the Abyss. A babau demon possesses the cunning of a devil and the bloodthirstiness of a demon. It has leathery black skin pulled tight over its gaunt frame, and a curved horn protruding from the back of its elongated skull. A bau's baleful glare can weaken a creature. MAW DEMON Maw demons share Yeenoghu's ceaseless hunger for carnage and mortal flesh. After a maw demon rests for 8 hours, anything devoured by it is transported directly into the Lord of Savagery's gullet. Maw demons appear among gnoll war bands, usually summoned as part of ritual offerings of freshly slain manoids made to Yeenoghu. The gnolls don't command them, but these demons accompany the war band and attack whatever creatures the gnolls fall upon. SHOOSUVA A shoosuva is a hyena-demon gifted by Yeenoghu to an especially powerful gnoll (typically as a fang of ghu). A shoosuva manifests shortly after a war band achieves a great victory, emerging from a billowing, fetid cloud of smoke as it arrives from the Abyss. In battle, the demon wraps its slavering jaws around one victim while lashing out with the poisonous stinger on its tail to bring down another one. A creature immobilized by the poison becomes easy pickings for any gnolls nearby. Each shoosuva is bonded to a particular gnoll and fights alongside its master. A gnoll that has been gifted with a shoosuva is second only to a flind in status within a war band. BABAU ",

BRONTOSAURUS This massive four-legged dinosaur is large enough that most predators leave it alone. Its deadly tail can drive away or kill smaller threats. DEINONYCHUS This larger cousin of the velociraptor kills by gripping its target with its claws and feeding while the creature is still alive. DIMETRODON This sail-backed reptile is commonly found in areas where dinosaurs live. It hunts on shores and in shallow water, filling a similar role as a crocodile. HADROSAURUS A hadrosaurus is a semi-quadrupedal herbivore nizable by its bony head crests. If raised as a hatchling, it can be trained to carry a Small or Medium rider. UETZALCOATLUS This giant relative of the pteranodon has a wingspan ceeding 30 feet. Although it can move on the ground like a quadruped, it is more comfortable in the air. STEGOSAURl!S This heavily built dinosaur has rows of plates on its back and a flexible, spiked tail held high to strike predators. It tends to travel in herds of mixed ages. VELOCIRAPTOR This feathered dinosaur is about the size of a large key. It is an aggressive predator and often hunts in packs to bring down larger prey.

Lit DRAEGLOTH A draegloth is a half-drow, half-glabrezu demon, born of a drow high priestess in an unholy, dangerous ritual. Gifted with innate magic and physical might, it usually remains in the service of its mother's house, lending its thirst for destruction to that house's plans to triumph over its rivals. A draegloth is an ogre-sized, four-armed humanoid with purple-black skin and yellow-white hair. Two of its arms are huge and muscular, tipped with sharp claws; the other two are the size and shape of drow arms, pable of delicate movements. Although the creature is heavily muscled, it is graceful and quiet like a drow. Its face is clearly demonic, with bestial features, glowing red eyes, an elongated doglike snout, and a mouth full of sharp teeth. Blessing on the House. The ritual to create a gloth succeeds only rarely, but when it does, it is a great event that is seen by the drow of the house as a sign of the demon lord Lolth's favor-and a sign of Lolth's disregard for the family's rivals, which were not thus gifted. The birth prompts the leaders of the house to begin crafting new plans to strike at its rivals when the draegloth is fully grown. These plans always use the draegloth in a significant role, because its abilities can turn the tide in a battle against a house that doesn't have a draegloth of its own. Subservient Enforcers. Although it plays an ant part in the welfare of its house, a draegloth can't rise above the status of a favored slave or a consort to a priestess. Before a draegloth is given any duties, it ceives instruction in accepting the role set for it and not challenging authority. Draegloths instinctively resist this sort of treatment, but most of them take out their tration on their house's enemies. A draegloth that can't suppress its ambitions might abandon its house and strike out on its own. Whether these rebellious gloths are part of Lolth's plan for sowing even greater chaos is unclear. Brute Cunning and Dark Magic. A draegloth loves the feeling of tearing opponents apart with its claws and teeth and of wielding the magic that courses through its veins. Most are too impatient to bother with complicated tactics, but a few go on to learn more destructive magic. DRAEGLOTH ",

        "flavorText": "FIRE NEWTS In regions that contain hot springs, volcanic activity, or similar hot and wet conditions, :firenewts might be found. These humanoid amphibians live in a ristic theocracy that reveres elemental fire in its worst incarnation. Heat Seekers. Firenewts need hot water to live and breed. A firenewt becomes sluggish, mentally and ically, after spending a week away from an external source of moist heat. A prolonged lack of heat can shut down a firenewt community, as the creatures within go into hibernation and their eggs stop developing. Firenewts delve for sources of heat in the earth, such as boiling mud and hot springs, that make ideal places to settle. Through excavation and mining in the area, they fashion living space and obtain an ample supply of minerals for other uses, such as smelting, smithing, and alchemy. A firenewt lair features a network of channels and sluices to circulate hot \nliquid through the settlement. The alchemy practiced by firenewts focuses on fire. One of their favorite mixtures is a paste of sulfur, eral salts, and oil. Firenewts chew this blend habitually, because doing so produces a pleasant internal heat and it enables a firenewt to vomit forth a small ball of flame. Most firenewts carry a container with this mixture in it. Religious Militants. Firenewt society and culture are based on the worship of Imix, the Prince of Evil Fire. This veneration of Imix leads firenewts to be aggressive, wrathful, and cruel. Firenewt warlocks of lmix teach that by demonstrating these qualities, a firenewt warrior in combat can become \"touched by the Fire Lord,\" ing a nearly unstoppable battle rage. Warlocks of Imix command warriors to prove their worth by going on raids to bring back treasure and tives. The warlocks take the choicest loot as a tithe to lmix, and then those who participated in the raid divide the rest according to merit. Prisoners that have no parent usefulness are sacrificed to Imix and then eaten. Those that are deemed capable of mining and performing other chores around the lair are kept as slaves for a while before meeting the same fate. When firenewts muster for war, rather than merely staging occasional raids, they take no prisoners. Their goal is nothing less than the annihilation of their and they reserve their greatest animosity for others of their kind. If two groups of firenewts come upon each other, it's likely that they're in competition for the same territory, and a bloody battle is the usual result. Giant Striders. Firenewts have a close relationship with a type of monstrous beast they believe Imix sent to aid them-borne out by the creatures' ability to send a gout of flame against distant enemies. Called giant striders, these monsters appear birdlike and reptilian, but are truly neither. Firenewts provide shelter, food, and breeding grounds in their lairs for giant striders, and the striders voluntarily serve as mounts for elite newt soldiers. FIRENEWT WARRIOR ",

Hunters might be lulled into a false sense of confidence upon sighting this derous, seemingly nonhostile creature. If any other ture large enough to be a threat approaches too close, though, the snail unleashes a flash of scintillating light and then attacks with its mace-like tentacles. Trail of Treasure. Left undisturbed, a flail snail moves slowly along the ground, consuming everything on the surface, including rocks, sand, and soil, stopping to relish crystal growths and other large mineral posits. It leaves behind a shimmering trail that quickly solidifies into a thin layer of a nearly transparent stance inedible to the snail. This glassy residue can be harvested and cut to form window panes of varying clearness. It can also be heated and spun into glass objects of other sorts. Some humanoids make a living from trailing flail snails to collect this glass. USING THE SHELL OF A FLAIL SNAIL A flail snail shell, which weighs about 250 pounds, has merous uses. One intact shell can sell for 5,000 gp. Many hunters seek the shell for its antimagic properties. A skilled armorer can make three shields from one shell. For 1 month. each shield gives its wielder the snaWs magic Shell trait. When the shield's magic fades, it leaves behind an exotic shield that is the perfect item from which to make a spellguard shield. A flail snail shell can also be used to make a robe of tillating colors. The shell is ground and added to the dye while the garment is being fashioned.

It lairs in swamps and has four tentacles, a thick rubbery hide, a fang-filled maw with a prehensile tongue, and an extendable stalk sporting three bulbous eyes that face in different directions. Otherworldly Entities. Froghemoths are creatures not of this world. A journal purportedly written long ago by the wizard Lum the Mad describes strange, cal chambers of metal buried in the ground from which froghemoths emerged, but no reliable reports of the cation of such places exist. Hungry from Birth. Every few years, a froghemoth can lay a fertile egg without mating. The froghemoth cares nothing for its egg, and might eat it the hatchling. A young froghemoth's survival is most often predicated on its parent leaving it behind in indifference. A born froghemoth grows to full size over a period of months by indiscriminately preying on other creatures in its swampy domain. It learns to hide its enormous body in murky pools, keeping only its eyestalk above water to watch for passing creatures. When food comes within reach, the froghemoth erupts from its pool, tacles and tongue flailing. It can grab several targets at once, keeping them at bay while it wraps its tongue around another one and pulls it in to be devoured. Revered by Bullywugs. If a bullywug tribe comes across a froghemoth, the bullywugs treat the froghemoth as a god and do all they can to coax the monster into their den. A froghemoth can be tamed (after a fashion) by offering it food, and bullywugs can communicate with it on a basic level, so the creature might eat only a few bullywugs before following the rest. Bullywugs gather food as tribute for it, provide it with a comfortable lair, fanatically protect it from harm, and try to ensure that any young froghemoth reaches maturity.",

CLOUD GIANT SMILING ONE Cloud giants aren't, on the whole, religious. They erate many conflicting ideas about their patron deity, Memnor. The smiling ones strain that tolerance. Smiling ones are cloud giants who honor and emulate Memnor's craftiness and deceit above all else. They are tricksters supreme who use sleight of hand, deception, misdirection, and magic in their pursuit of wealth. They also possess a flair for unpredictability and a wicked sense of humor. While cloud giants expect a certain amount of trickery and deceit in their dealings with others of their kind, smiling ones overstep the bounds of decorum with their behavior, doing and saying things that nobler cloud ants consider beneath the dignity of their kind. Mysterious Masks. Smiling ones take their name from the strange two-faced masks they wear. The ing half of the face often looks more like a smirk or a umphant sneer than a pleasant grin. The frowning half represents the displeasure smiling ones feel about their place in the ordning-second to the storm giants. The masks serve as symbols of their devotion, but they also conceal their wearers' true facial expressions. b-; -4 $ ;a &s;;& · f .-§? · 54-¾SA -SW,4?¥ CLOUD GIANT SMILING ONE  . e -e -#ia * FIRE GIANT DREADNOUGHT The ordning for fire giants emphasizes not just strength but also skill at forgecraft.

These shields bear spikes on their exterior and have hollow interiors into which the dreadnought pours hot coals at the first sign of danger. Armed with its two shields, the dreadnought can present a fiery wall to any attacker. When the dreadnought has finished, often all that is left of a foe is a smoking smear on the floor. When not called on to fight, dreadnoughts maintain their strength by using their shields to shove huge tities of coal, stone, or ore about the foundry. Occasionatly, dreadnoughts are called on by their superiors to company a war or diplomatic delegation, The presence of the dreadnoughts presents a fierce face in either case. FROST GIANT EVERLASTING ONE To hold its place or rise within the ordning, a frost giant must routinely face mighty foes in single combat. Some setk out magic that will aid them, but enchanted objects can be taken or lost. True greatness relies on personal prowess. Faced with this truth, a frost giant might seek a supernatural gift from Vaprak the Destroyer. Troll Eater. Frost giants mainly turn to Vaprak, a pacious god of strength and hunger worshiped by ogres and trolls, out of desperation. Vaprak likes to tempt frost giants with dreams of glory followed by nightmares of bloody cannibalism. Those who don't shrink from such visions or report them to priests of Thrym receive more of the same. If a frost giant comes to relish these dreams and nightmares, as some do, Vaprak sets a troll upon a sacred quest to find the frost giant and meet it in secret. The troll offers up its own body to be devoured in Vaprak's name. Only the boldest and most determined frost giants can finish such a gory feast. Vaprak's Blessing. After devouring the troll sent by Vaprak, bones and all, a frost giant becomes an ing one, gaining tremendous strength, an ill temper, and a troll's regenerative ability. With these gifts, the frost giant can swiftly claim the title of jarl and easily fend off rivals for decades. However, if the frost giant doesn't give enough honor to Vaprak or fails to heed Vaprak's sions, injuries the frost giant sustains heal wrong, often resulting in discolored skin, warty scars, and vestigial body parts, such as extra digits, limbs, and even extra heads. The touch of Vaprak can no longer be hidden then, and the everlasting one is either killed or exiled by its clan. Sometimes small communities of everlasting ones gather and even reproduce, passing the \"blessing\" and worship of Vaprak from one generation to the next.",

What the lazy brutes don't comprehend are the things that make them sick. They consume spoiled food and diseased carcasses with as much enthusiasm as childreri. eating dessert. Fortunately for hill giants, they have a vulture's tion and rarely suffer for such eating habits. This makes it all the more mysterious to them when one of their kind becomes ill and incapable of keeping down food. Vomiting hill giants are seen as vessels of a message from Grolantor. The clan separates the sickened giant from the others, often trapping the giant in a cage or tying the giant to a post. A priest of Grolantor or chieftain visits the fam· ished giant daily, trying to read portents in the puddles of bile the hill giant retched up. If the sickness soon passes, the hill giant can rejoin society. If not, the hill giant is instead starved to the point of madness so that Grolantor's hunger can be given a mouth in the world. Starved and Insane. A mouth of Grolantor is so graced that it ceases to be an individual and becomes an object. Paradoxically, that object is revered as a holy embodiment of Grolantor's eternal, aching hunger. Unlike a typical thick, sluggish, half-asleep hill giant, a mouth of Grolantor is thin as a whippet, alert like a bird, and constantly twitching around the edges. A mouth of Grolantor is kept perpetually imprisoned or shackled; if it breaks free, it's sure to kill a few hill giants before it's brought down or it sprints away on a killing spree. The only time a mouth of Grolantor is set loose is during a war, a raid against an enemy settlement, or in a ditch defense of the tribe's home. When the mouth of Grolantor has slaughtered and eaten its fill of the tribe's enemies, it passes out amid the gory remains of its tims, making it easy to recapture.\n",

It is as wildly changeable as a dream, and that's how they regard it-as a dream. Nothing there is permanent, so nothing there is real. What happens on the surface doesn't matter. Promises and bargains made there needn't be honored. Life and even art hold less value there. Dream Dwellers. Stone giants sometimes go on dream quests in the surface world, seeking inspiration for their art, to break a decades-long ennui, or out of simple curiosity. Some who go on these quests let selves become lost in the dream. Other stone giants are banished to the surface as punishment. Regardless of the reason, if they don't take shelter under stone, such individuals can become dreamwalkers. Dreamwalkers occupy an odd place of respect outside of stone giant ordning. They are considered outcasts, but their familiarity with the surface world makes them valuable guides, and their insights can help other stone giants grasp the dangers of living in a dream. Mad Wanderers. Dreamwalkers are driven mad by isolation, shame, and their unendingly alien roundings, and this madness leeches out into the world around them, affecting other creatures that get too close. Believing that they're living in a dream and that their actions have no real consequences, dreamwalkers act as they please, becoming forces of chaos.

They plumb the depths of their powerful connection to the elements and disperse themselves into nature, literally transforming into semiconscious storms. The blizzard that rages unendingly around a mountain peak, the vortex that swirls around a remote island, or the thunderstorm that howls ceaselessly up and down a rugged coastline could, in fact, be the ing form of a storm giant clinging to existence. \" Elemental Weapons. A storm giant quintessent sheds its armor and weapons, but gains the power to form makeshift weapons out of thin air. When the giant has no further use of them, or when the giant dies, its mental weapons disappear. CHAPTER 3 I BESTIARY Forsaken Form. A storm giant quintessent can revert to its true giant form on a whim. The change is rary but can be maintained long enough for the giant to communic~te with a mortal, carry out a short task, or defend its home against aggressors. A QUINTESSENT'S LAIR A storm giant quintessent has no need for castles or dungeon lairs. Its lair is usually a secluded region or prominent geographic feature, such as a mountain peak, a great waterfall, a remote island, a fog-shrouded loch, a beautiful coral reef, or a windswept desert bluff. As befits the environment, the storm in which the giant lives could be a blizzard, a typhoon, a thunderstorm, or a sandstorm. Lair Actions. A storm giant quintessent can use lair actions in giant form and while transformed into a storm. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the giant can take a lair action to cause one of the lowing effects; the giant can't use the same effect two rounds in a row: Ł The giant creates a thunderclap centered on a point anywhere in its lair. Each creature within 20 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throwor be deafened until the end of its next turn. Ł The giant creates a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog (or murky water within water) centered on a point where in its lair. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured.

        "flavorText": " i-· Ł\" a # c · ... ,Rt ?S?f · ·#! .aa-N!±& GIRALLON A girallon looks like an oversized, four-armed ape with gray skin and white fur. Its fangs and claws set it apart from a normal ape, revealing it to be a strous predator. Forest Hunters. Girallons are most common in perate or warm forest environments abundant with life. They share the ape's adeptness at climbing, although these half-ton creatures shy away from scaling trees that can't support their bulk. Instead, they stalk the forest floor, lurk in narrow ravines or shallow caves, or hide in ruined sites while waiting for prey to come near. A girallon is surprisingly stealthy, considering its size and its lack of camouflage. Girallons form loose bands of several individuals and their offspring, usually led by a dominant adult that also tends to be the oldest member of the group. When on the hunt away from their lair, girallons use roars and body language to communicate with one another over tance. Each individual typically hunts alone and widely separated from the others, to ensure that everyone gets adequate fodder. The leader might organize members to work together to make a big kill. If they succeed, one in the group shares the spoils, with the best parts going to mothers caring for their young. Wall Climbers. The ruins of humanoid habitations, especially those found in deep forests and jungles, seem to attract girallons. They move effortlessly along stairs and balconies, as well as on the sloped rooftops and buttresses of such formations. To a girallon, a city's buildings are just another sort of forest-and better yet, one whose uppermost \"branches\" can easily support the creatures. In such a setting, the girallons take full advantage of their skill in climbing. The creatures can easily scale walls and battlements, and they perch on tower tops and other high vantages to keep an eye on the surrounding area. Magical Origin. The social habits of wild girallons are unusual for apes, as is their instinctive attraction to humanoid structures. These facts, together with the rallon's appearance, lead sages to believe that girallons were created through magic to serve as guardians for some lost empire. When that empire fell ages ago, lons turned feral and spread out across the world. In the time since then, numerous creatures have tried to tame, subjugate, or cooperate with the monsters. For instance, yuan-ti enslave girallons, turning them into border sentinels for their serpent kingdoms. Because girallons are known to be peaceful among their own kind, some humanoids have learned how to approach a group's leader, offering food and other gifts in hopes of establishing an alliance with the creatures. Girallons that are well treated might be willing to serve as guards, though they lack the intelligence to take on tasks more complicated than attacking strangers that enter their domain. If one is taken young and properly trained, a girallon could end up in a seemingly unlikely place, such as guarding the entrance to a city's thieves' guild. Those who would keep a girallon as a pet must always be wary, because the creature could revert to its predatory nature at any time.",

These gnolls eschew the use of ranged weapons in favor of short blades that they wield with speed and ciency. In the thick of a fight, they are capable of dashing across the field, slashing and snarling as they run down stragglers and finish off wounded foes. GNOLL HUNTER Hunters are the stealthiest gnolls in a war band, and they put their talents to use on the battlefield in a ber of ways. In the vanguard of a war band, hunters creep around, picking off isolated opposition while clearing the way for the rest of the force to run shod over the enemy's territory. Hunters are particularly skilled with the longbow, and they fire arrows with viciously barbed heads. Even when a hunter doesn't kill its target with its first shot, the arrow strike brings so much pain that the victim is hobbled in its attempt to run away. When a hunter on the prowl finds prey and isn't concerned about remaining stealthy, it sounds a horn crafted from bone that pr~ duces a keening wail similar to a banshee's yell.

These gnolls eschew the use of ranged weapons in favor of short blades that they wield with speed and ciency. In the thick of a fight, they are capable of dashing across the field, slashing and snarling as they run down stragglers and finish off wounded foes. GNOLL HUNTER Hunters are the stealthiest gnolls in a war band, and they put their talents to use on the battlefield in a ber of ways. In the vanguard of a war band, hunters creep around, picking off isolated opposition while clearing the way for the rest of the force to run shod over the enemy's territory. Hunters are particularly skilled with the longbow, and they fire arrows with viciously barbed heads. Even when a hunter doesn't kill its target with its first shot, the arrow strike brings so much pain that the victim is hobbled in its attempt to run away. When a hunter on the prowl finds prey and isn't concerned about remaining stealthy, it sounds a horn crafted from bone that pr~ duces a keening wail similar to a banshee's yell.

They are fiercely territorial and see themselves as superior to most other creatures. Tree-Dwelling Amphibians. Grungs live in trees and prefer shade. A grung hatchery is maintained in guarded ground-level pools. About three months after hatching, a grung tadpole takes on the shape of an adult. It takes another six to nine months for a grung juvenile to reach maturity. Castes and Colors. Grung society is a caste system. Each caste lays eggs in a separate hatching pool, and juvenile grungs join their caste upon emergence from the hatchery. All grungs are a dull greenish gray when they are born, but each individual takes on the color of its caste as it grows to adulthood. Green grungs are the tribe's warriors, hunters, and laborers, and blue grungs work as artisans and in other domestic roles. Supervising and guiding both groups are the purple grungs, which serve as administrators and commanders. (Use the grung stat block to sent members of the green, blue, and purple castes.) Red grungs are the tribe's scholars and magic users. They are superior to purple, blue, and green grungs and given proper respect even by grungs of higher status. (Use the grung wildling stat block to represent bers of the red caste.) Higher castes include orange grungs, which are elite warriors that have authority over all lesser grungs, and gold grungs, which hold the highest leadership tions. A tribe's sovereign is always a gold grung. (Use the grung elite warrior stat block to represent members of the orange and gold castes.) A grung normally remains in its caste for life. On rare occasions, an individual that distinguishes itself with great deeds can earn an invitation to join a higher caste. Through a combination of herbal tonics and ritual magic, an elevated grung changes color and is inducted into its new caste in the same way that a juvenile of the VARIANT: GRUNC POISON Grung poison loses its potency \n1 minute after being moved from a grung. A similar breakdown occurs if the grung dies. A creature poisoned by a grung can suffer an additional effect that varies depending on the grung's skin color. This effect lasts until the creature is no longer poisoned by the grung. Green. The poisoned creature can't move except to climb or make standing jumps. Jf the creature is flying, it can't take any actions or reactions unless it lands. Blue. The poisoned creature must shout loudly or wise make a loud noise at the start and end ofits turn. Purple. The poisoned creature feels a desperate need to soak itselfin liquid or mud. It can't take actions or move except to do so or to reach a body offiquid or mud. Red.

Naturally Toxic. All grungs secrete a substance that is harmless to them but poisonous to other creatures. A grung also uses venom to poison its weapons. Slavers. Grungs are always on the lookout for tures they can capture and enslave. Grungs use slaves for all manner of menial tasks, but mostly they just like bossing them around. Slaves are fed mildly poisoned food to keep them lethargic and compliant. A creature afflicted in this way over a long period of time becomes a shell of its former self and can be restored to normalcy only by magic. Water Dependency. A grung that fails to immerse itself in water for at least 1 hour during a day suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of that day.

When trained properly, a drake is obedient, loyal, and territorial, which makes it an excellent watchbeast that can follow simple commands. Gifts from Dragons. The ritual to create a guard drake was originally devised by the cult of \nTiamat, but has spread to other groups that are skilled in arcana and associated with dragons. The cooperation of a dragon is necessary for the ritual to succeed, and a dragon ically provides its help when it wants to reward its allies or worshipers with a valuable servant. The ritual, which takes several days, requires 10 pounds of fresh dragon scales (donated by the dragon allied with the group), a large amount of fresh meat, and an iron cauldron. When the process is complete, a halfling-sized egg emerges from the cauldron and is ready to hatch within a few hours. Eager to Learn. A newly hatched guard drake prints upon the first creature that feeds it (usually the one planning to train it), establishing an aggressive but trusting bond with that individual. A guard drake is fully grown within two to three weeks and can be trained in the same length of time. One is the equivalent of a guard dog in terms of what it can be trained to do. A guard drake resembles the type of dragon it was ated from, but with a wingless, squat, muscular build. A drake can't reproduce, nor can its scales be used to make other guard drakes.

        "flavorText": "ANNIS HAG \nHAGS Hags delight in bringing ruin and misery to the world. Malevolence is such a core part of a hag that it shapes her physical form and molds her magical powers. ANNIS HAG Annis hags lair in mountains or hills. Despite being hunchbacked and hump-shouldered, they are the largest and most physically imposing of their kind, standing eight feet tall. Tormenting the Weak. Although annis hags can ily tear a grown man apart, they love hunting children, preferring their flesh above all others. They use the flayed skin of such victims to make supple leather, and a hag's lair often shows the signs of this industry. Annis hags leave tokens of their cruelty at the edges of forests and other areas they claim. In this way, they provoke fear and paranoia in nearby villages and ments. To an annis hag, nothing is sweeter than turning a vibrant community into a place paralyzed with terror, where folk never venture out at night, strangers are met with suspicion and anger, and parents warn their dren to \"be good, or the annis will get you.\" Child Corrupter. When an annis feels especially cruel, she disguises herself as a kindly-looking elderly woman, approaches a child in a remote place, and gives it an iron token that it can use to confide in her. Over time, \"Granny\" convinces the child that it's okay to have bad thoughts and do bad deeds-starting with breaking things or wandering outside without permission, then graduating to pushing someone down the stairs or ting a house on fire. Sooner or later, the child's family and community become terrified of the \"bad seed\" and must face the awful decision of whether the child should be punished or exiled. Tribe Mather. Much in the way that they befriend children in order to corrupt them, annis hags have a tendency for adopting a group of ogres, trolls, or other loutish creatures, ruling them through brute strength, verbal abuse, and superstition. Covens. An annis hag that is part of a coven (see the \"Hag Covens\" sidebar in the Monster Manual) has a challenge rating of 8 (3,900 XP). IRON TOKEN An annis hag can pull out one of her iron teeth or nails and spend 1 minute shaping and polishing it into the form of a coin, a ring, or a tiny mirror. Thereafter, any creature that holds th1s iron token can have a whispered conversation with the hag, provided the creature and the hag are on the same plane of existence and within 10 miles of each other. The holder of the token can hear only the hag's voice, not those of any other creatures or any ambient noise around the hag. Similarly, the hag can hear the holder of the token and not the noise around it. A hag can have up to three ;,on tokens active at one time. As an action, she can discern the direction and mate distance to all of her active tokens. She can taneously deactivate any of her tokens at any distance (no action required), whereupon the token retains its current form but loses its magi-cal properties. ",

Bheur hags are attracted to selfish tions justified by deadly cold, such as murdering a eler for a winter coat, chopping down a dryad's grove for firewood, and so on. These actions are especially sweet to a bheur if they are unwarranted, such as a greedy merchant hoarding more food for the winter than he could possibly eat while others starve. Bheurs love to seed such ideas and thoughts in mortals. They use their ability to manipulate weather to batter villages with snow and freezing cold, hoping to instill despair that turns the villagers against each other. A bheur hag loves watching unprepared people suffer and die for their mistakes during the winter. She is lighted when mortals make petty, pathetic attempts to survive, such as eating boots and leather scraps when no real food is to be found. Awful to Behold.

The Academy of Devastation and the Iron Shadows are two such ganizations, and their graduates are feared among the ranks of goblinkind. HOBGOBLIN DEVASTATOR In hobgoblin society, the Academy of Devastation tifies hobgoblins with a talent for magic and puts them through a grueling training regimen that endows them with the ability to call down fireballs and other tive magic on the host's behalf. A hobgoblin devastator on the battlefield is simultaneously a boon to all its allies and a threat to every foe around it. Into the Fray. While other cultures treat their wizards as cloistered academics, hobgoblins expect their casters to fight. Devastators learn the basics of weapon use, and they measure their deeds by the enemies feated though their magic. ,.-Devastators have the respect of other members of the host, and they receive obedience and deference from many quarters. Their ability to lay waste to entire tions with a single use of magic allows them to gain far more glory in battle than a single warrior. Other cultures might view the use of such abilities as a short cut to glory, but to hobgoblins a gift for magic is as valued and useful as a strong sword arm or brilliance in tactics. They are all boons from Maglubiyet that must be cultivated and unleashed upon the enemy. Only Results Matter. Devastators study a simplified form of evocation magic. Their training lacks the theory and context that other folk study, making them skilled in battle but relatively illiterate on the finer points of how and why their magic works. The Academy of Devastation believes that an demic approach to magic is a sign of weakness and inefficiency. A warrior doesn't need to know about allurgy to wield a blade, so why should a wizard care about where \nmagic comes from? Devastators love to prove their superiority in battle by seeking out enemy spellcasters and destroying them. ~., C --z:::; St-; A;; ¥ HOBGOBLIN DEVASTATOR ",

        "flavorText": "KOBOLDS Some kobolds have gifts bequeathed to them by dragons or gods, enabling them to rise above their peers. Others are born with a cruel inventiveness that few can match. KOBOLD DRAGONSHIELD A kobold dragonshield is a champion of its race. Almost all dragonshields begin life as normal kobolds, then are chosen by a dragon and invested with great powers for the purpose of protecting the dragon's eggs, but once every few years a kobold hatches with an innate version of the dragonshield's abilities. Accomplished at hand combat, it bears many scars from desperate fights and carries a shield made out of cast-off dragon scales. Uncommon Courage. A dragonshield knows that it has a place of honor in the tribe, but-being kobolds at heart-most of them feel unworthy of their status and thus desperate to prove themselves deserving of it. A dragonshield's natural kobold cowardice is still present in its makeup, and thus it might still run away from a threat. But it also has the ability to rally in the face of certain death, inspiring other kobolds to follow it in a charge against the invaders of their warren. KOBOLD INVENTOR A kobold inventor, crafty and with quick hands, builds improvised weapons in the hope of gaining some new advantage in combat. An inventor captures bugs, scoops up exotic dungeon slimes, and claims the best stolen goods as ingredients in its experiments. Its creations are sometimes comical in appearance, but-like bolds' traps-they work a lot better than their materials would suggest. Good While They Last. An inventor's new weapons last for only one or two attacks before they break, but might be st,1rprisingly effective in the meantime. Most inventors are skilled enough that their improvised ons don't backfire on them, but other users might not be so lucky. The weapons don't have to be lethal-in many cases one serves its purpose if it distracts, scares, or confuses a creature long enough for other kobolds to kill the enemy. In any particular encounter, an inventor ally has one or two improvised weapons at its disposal. KOBOLD SCALE SORCERER A kobold scale sorcerer has an innate talent for arcane magic, making it a highly valuable member of the tribe for several reasons. Because the kobolds' deity remains imprisoned, most tribes lack individuals that can use divine magic, and so the scale sorcerers fill the roles of advisor and historian. In times of peace, they use their spells to fortify and enhance the warren and aid the rest of the tribe. When the tribe is threatened, a scale cerer lashes out with fire and poison against enemies, saving a bit of magic for itself in case it needs to flee or take advantage of a captor. Duty-Bound to a Dragon. In a kobold tribe associated with a dragon, typically one that resides in or near the dragon's lair, the scale sorcerer also serves as diplomat and mouthpiece-anticipating the dragon's needs, issu-KOBOLD DRAGONSHIELD  I? f i· a -Ł.... ce;;e Pft ···#f X&t ¥ CHAPTER '.5",

They primarily live in forests, although they adapt well to ban and subterranean settings. Fear Incarnate. Meenlocks are spawned by fear. Whenever fear overwhelms a creature in the Feywild, or in any other location where the Feywild's influence is strong, one or more meenlocks might spontaneously arise in the shadows or darkness nearby. If more than one meenlock is born, a lair also magically forms. The earth creaks and moans as narrow, twisting tunnels open up within it. One of these newly formed ways serves as the lair's only entrance and exit. Meenlocks give other creatures the creeps and project a supernatural aura that instills terror in those nearby. So evil and twisted are they that a palpable sense of foreboding haunts those who intrude upon a meenlock lair. Inside the warren, black moss covers every surface, muffling sound. A large central chamber serves as the meenlocks' den, where they torment captives. Dark Dwellers. A meenlock shuns bright light. It can supernaturally sense areas of darkness and shadow in its vicinity and thus is able to teleport from one ened space to another-enabling it to sneak up on its prey or run away when outmatched. Telepathic Tormentors. Meenlocks have no form of communication other than telepathy. They can use it to project unsettling hallucinations into the minds of their prey. These hallucinations take the form of terrible pers or fleeting movements just at the edges of one's peripheral vision. During the day, meenlocks confine themselves to their dark warrens. At night, they crawl out of their tunnels to torment sleeping prey, particularly those who seem to embody all that is good in the world. Meenlocks like to paralyze creatures with their claws, drag them back to their hidden den, beat them unconscious, and ically torture them over a period of hours. A humanoid that succumbs to this psychic torment undergoes a transformation into an evil, full-grown meenlock (see the \"Telepathic Torment\" sidebar). TELEPATHIC TORMENT Up to four meenlocks can telepathically torment one pacitated creature, filling its mind with disturbing sounds and dreadful imagery. Participating meenlocks can't use their telepathy for any other purpose during this time. though they can move about and take actions and tions as normal. This torment has no effect on a creature that is immune to the frightened condition. If the creature is susceptible and remains incapacitated for 1 hour, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. taking 10 (3d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The save DC is 10 + the num· ber of meenlocks participating in the torment, considering only those that remain within sight of the victim for the entire hour and aren't incapacitated during it The process can be repeated. A humanoid that drops to 0 hit points as a result of this damage instantly transforms into a meen· lock at full health and under -the DM's controL Only a wish spell or divine intervention can restore a transformed ture to its former state.

If this damage reduces the get to 0 hit points, the lich kills the target by extracting and devouring its brain. Mind Blast (Recharge 5-6). The lich magically emits chic energy in a 60-foot cone.

Master Minds. Illithids innately recognize that an tharid's survival is more important than their own. An elder brain's reaction to the rise of an ulitharid varies. In most colonies, the ulitharid becomes an elder brain's most favored servant, invested with power and authority. In others, the elder brain perceives an ulitharid as a tential rival for power, and it manipulates or quashes the ulitharid's ambitions accordingly. Birth of a Colony. When an ulitharid finds sharing leadership with an elder brain to be insufferable, it breaks off from the colony, taking a group of mind flayers with it, and moves to another location to form a new colony. After the death of the ulitharid's body, mind flayers take its brain and place it in a brine pool, where it grows into an elder brain over a few days. This cess doesn't work on the brain of an ulitharid that dies a natural death, as a brain that succumbs to old age is \ntoo decrepit to be used in the creation of an elder brain. Extractor Staff. Each ulitharid carries a psionically enhanced staff made of black metal. When the ulitharid is ready to give up its life, it attaches the staff to the back of its head, and the staff cracks open its skull and peels it apart, enabling its brain to be extracted. The brain and the staff are then planted in the ulitharid's corpse, ing it to dissolve into ichor. This psionically potent slime helps to fuel the transformation of the area into a brine pool that surrounds an embryonic elder brain. CHA.PTElt",

The creature can poison the body and the mind of its target, able to subjugate other beings that are wise physically superior. Alien Tyrants. Neogi usually dwell in far-flung tions on the Material Plane, as well as in the Feywild, the Shadowfell, and the Astral and Ethereal Planes. They invaded the world long ago from a remote tion on the Material Plane, abandoning their home to conquer and devour creatures in other realms. To meet their need to navigate great distances, the neogi first dominated and assimilated the umber hulks of another lost world. Then, with these slaves providing the ical labor, the neogi designed and built sleek vessels, some capable of traversing the planes, to carry them to their new frontiers. Some neogi groups still create and use such vehicles, which have a distinct spidery aspect. Some neogi use magic-the result of a pact between the neogi and aberrant entities they met during their journey from their home world. These entities look like stars and embody the essence of evil. They are known by such names as Acamar, Caiphon, Gibbeth, and Hadar. Nothing about the neogi is more unf3rthomable than their mentality. Because they have the power to control minds, neogi consider doing so to be entirely priate. Their society makes no distinction between individuals, aside from the ability that a given creature has to control others, and they don't comprehend the emotional aspects of existence that humans and similar beings experience. To a neogi, hatred is as foreign a sensation as love, and showing loyalty in the absence of authority is foolishness. Cycle of Death and Life. A neogi lives about as long as a human, and like a human it faces ical and mental infirmity as it ages. When an individual is rendered weak by advanced age, the other neogi in the group overpower it and inject it with a special poison. The toxin forms the old neogi into a bloated, helpless mass of flesh called a great old master. Young neogi lay their eggs atop it, and when the lings emerge, they devour the great old master and one another, until only a few of the strongest newborns are left. Hierarchy of Ownership. Surviving neogi hatchlings begin their lives under the control of adult neogi. They must learn about their ciety and earn a place in it, and each one starts its training by gaining mastery over a young umber hulk. Neogi mark themselves and their slaves through the use of dyes, transformational magic, and tattoos intended to signify rank, ments, and ownership. By these signs, each neogi can identify its betters-and it must defer to those of higher station or risk harsh punishment. 7 .... ir 4 $ AS:SN §ii ·i-S w NEOGI HATCHLING  Damn ŁŁl·Ł id ettsJave Us :u,~tt Łant to tlaey don't t ud no, Łste Aood, -Volo",

Yeth hounds fly in pursuit of their prey, often waiting until it is too exhausted to fight back. Only the threat of dawn drives the pack back into hiding. Minions of a Dark Master. A pack of yeth hounds can be created by powerful fey such as the Queen of Air and Darkness. Once it is brought into existence, a pack must have a master, who is often someone the creator wishes to reward. The master can telepathically communicate with its yeth hounds to give them commands from afar. If the master of a pack is killed, the hounds seek and choose a new master, typically an individual of great evil such as a vampire, a necromancer, or a hag. A yeth hound stands about 5 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs around 400 pounds. Often all that can be seen of one in the darkness is the red glow of its eyes against its night-black fur. The head of a yeth hound has a human-like face, held up by a neck more flexible than a dog's. The creature gives off an odor like smoke. Sound ofLoomins Death. Yeth hounds make a ghastly baying sound that can be heard all around. tures that can see a hound when it bays are filled with supernatural fear and usually flee in terror. When a tim tries to run away, a hound delights in chasing after it and tormenting it before bringing the hunt to a close. Those that stand their ground and fight back discover that mundane weapons partially pass through the hound as if it was made of fog, but magic weapons and silvered weapons can strike true. Foiled by Sunlight. Yeth hounds can't stand sunlight. A pack never willingly prolongs a hunt beyond the night hours and always seeks to return to its dark den before the first rays of dawn. No amount of coercion by a pack's master can deter this behavior. If a yeth hound is posed to natural sunlight, it fades away, vanishing into the Ethereal Plane, from where its master can retrieve it only after the sun has set. ; · · MS¥fr-YETH .HQUND ",

Those who mistake its might for divine power and those who seek to appease the monster through veneration are sometimes rewarded with power, to serve thereafter as kraken priests. The kraken can make itself dimly aware of a kraken priest's thoughts if the two are on the same plane of istence, and it can then push aside the priest's ity and control it. Kraken priests can thereby act as eyes and ears for their masters, and when the kraken has something to say, the priest becomes its mouthpiece. Every kraken priest undergoes a change in ance that reflects the kraken's influence, although each one differs in how its \nreverence is displayed. One kraken priest might have ink-black eyes and a suckered tentacle for a tongue, while another has a featureless face and a body covered in eyes and mouths that dribble seawater. These horrific manifestations intensify when the kraken possesses its minion to utter its dire pronouncements. • -. ¥ ., ¥ ** . w f -'\"?-if KR.A.KEN PRIEST APPENDIX B I NONPLAY:£R CMARACTERS",

On rare occasions, an illithid colony lapses, typically after an external assault, and the elder brain is killed. When that happens, the colony's tadpoles are suddenly freed from their fate. They no longer serve as food, and in turn are no longer fed by their ers. Driven by hunger, they turn to devouring one other. Only one tadpole survives out of the thousands in the colony's pool, and it emerges as a neothelid. Abhorrent to lllithids. Among the strongest taboos in illithid society is the idea of allowing a mature tadpole to survive without implanting it into a donor brain. Under normal circumstances, any tadpole that grows larger than a few inches in length is killed by the elder brain to be food for it or for less mature tadpoles. Any tadpole that survives beyond that state is perceived as a threat to the colony, and the mind flayers organize hunting parties to exterminate the abomination. Lacking enough intelligence to be detected by an elder brain's power to sense thoughts, neothelids warrant such precautions. Savage Behemoth. As a feral thing, a neothelid knows nothing beyond the predatory existence it has lived so far and struggles to comprehend its new psionic abilities. Neothelids prowl subterranean passages in search of more brains to sate their constant hunger, growing ever more vicious. These creatures can spray tissue-dissolving enzymes from their tentacle ducts, reducing victims to a puddle of slime and leaving only the pulsing brain unharmed. They have no knowledge of their link to illithids, so they're just as likely to prey on mind fl.ayers as on anything else. t ---: SfSS NEOTHELID ",

        "flavorText": "NILBOG  NILBOG When Maglubiyet conquered the goblin gods, he tended to leave only Khurgorbaeyag alive as a harsh overseer who would keep the goblins under heel. But the goblins' pantheon included a trickster deity who was termined to get the last laugh. Although its essence was shattered by Maglubiyet, this trickster god survives in splintered form as a possessing spirit that arises when goblinoids form a host, causing disorder in the ranks less it is appeased. Goblins have no name for this deity and dare not give it one, lest Maglubiyet use its name to ensnare and crush it as he did their other deities. They call the possessing spirit, and the goblin possessed by it, a nilbog (\"goblin\" spelled backward), and they revel in the fear that a nilbog sows among the ranks of the bears and hobgoblins in the host. Goblins' Reven;e. When goblinoids form a host, there is a chance that a goblin will become possessed by a nilbog, particularly if the goblin has been mistreated by its betters. This possession turns the goblin into a cracking, impish creature fearless of reprisal. It gives the goblin strange powers that drive others to do the posite of what they desire. Attacking a goblin possessed by a nilbog is foolhardy, and killing the creature just prompts the spirit to possess another goblin. The only way to keep a nilbog from wreaking havoc is to treat it well and give it respect and praise. No joking Matter. The possible presence of a nilbog in a host has given rise to a practice among goblinoids that each host include at least one goblin jester. This jester is allowed to go anywhere and do whatever it pleases. The position of jester is a much sought-after one among the goblins, because even if the jester is ously not a nilbog, hobgoblins and bugbears indulge its manic behavior. NILBOCISM A nilbog is an invisible spirit that possesses only goblins. Bereft of a host, the spirit has a flying speed of 30 feet and can't speak or be attacked. The only action it can take is to attempt to possess a goblin within 5 feet of it. A goblin targeted by the spirit must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or become possessed. While possessed by the spirit, the goblin's alignment becomes chaotic evil, its Charisma becomes 15 (unless it was al~ ready higher), and it gains the nilbog's Innate Spellcasting and Nilbogism traits, as well as its Reversal of Fortune reaction. If the save succeeds, the spirit can't possess that goblin for 24 hours. If its host is killed or the possession is ended by a spell such as hallow, magic circle, or protection from evil and good, the spirit searches for another goblin to possess. The spirit can leave its host at any time, but it won't do so willingly unless it knows there's another potential host nearby. A goblin stripped of its nilbog spirit reverts to its normal statistics and loses the traits it gained while possessed.",

In gloomy places where the veil between the Shadowfell and the Material Plane is thinnest, they can cross over into the dark realms of the world. Ravenous Lurkers. Shadow mastiffs hunt in packs on the Shadowfell, so when one of them enters a rift between the planes, several more are sure to follow. Each pack is led by an alpha (male or female) that is the smartest and toughest one of the group. The alpha must remain sharp to keep the rest of the pack in line, lest it be killed and replaced. When a shadow mastiff pack is hungry and senses prey nearby, the alpha lets loose a howl that strikes fear into the hearts of nearby beasts and humanoids. Its howl is also a signal to the rest of the pack to move in for the kill. Gloom provides a shadow mastiff with supernatural protection, granting it resistance to nonmagical ons while in dim light or darkness. Shadow mastiffs can tolerate bright light, but they shun sunlight. Summoned for Service. Some faiths devoted to ities of gloom and night, such as Shar in the Forgotten Realms, perform unholy rites to summon shadow tiffs from the Shadowfell and then put them to work as temple sentinels, bodyguards, and punishers of lievers, heretics, and apostates. The method for bringing shadow mastiffs into the world is also known by other strong-willed and evil-minded individuals, who find use for the hounds as guards in their strongholds. Ethereal Sight. In addition to its other capabilities, a shadow mastiff can see creatures and objects on the Ethereal Plane. This extraplanar perception makes a mastiff an especially skilled guardian, especially in ations when magical or spiritual incursion is likely. SHADOW MASTIFF ALPHA A shadow mastiff alpha has the statistics of a normal shadow mastiff, with the following modifications:  The alpha has above average (42-54) hit points.  It has an Intelligence of 6 (;...2).  It has the Terrifying How1 action option described below. Terrifying Howl. The shadow mastiff howls. Any beast or humanoid within 300 feet of the mastiff and able to hear its howl must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to any shadow mastiff's Terrifying Howl for the next 24 hours. g; : ; re$$ S fits -t ;;+gs:& &~-SHADOW MASTIFF ",

Innocuous and insidious at the same time, a tracker flows into places where a normal creature can't go and brings its own brand of watery death down upon its quarry. Vengeance at Any Cost. The ritual for creating a ering tracker is known to hags, liches, and priests who worship gods of vengeance. It can only be performed on a willing creature that hungers for revenge. The ritual sucks all the moisture from the person's body, killing it. Yet the mind lives on in the puddle of liquid that issues forth from the remains, and so too does the subject's insatiable need for retribution. Stealthy Assassins. A slithering tracker tastes the ground it courses over, seeking any trace of its prey. To kill, a slithering tracker rises up and enshrouds a ture, attempting to drown the prey while also draining it of blood. A slithering tracker that has killed in this fashion becomes much easier to locate for a time, since its liquid form becomes tinged with blood and its body leaves a visible trail of the stuff behind it. Descent into Madness. Achieving revenge against its target doesn't end a slithering tracker's existence, nor its hunger for blood. Some slithering trackers main aware of their purpose and extend their quest for vengeance to others, such as anyone who supported or befriended the original target. Most of the time, though, a tracker's mind can't cope with being trapped in liquid form, unable to communicate, and driven by the desire for blood: after a tracker fulfills its duty, insanity takes over the creature, and it attacks indiscriminately until it is destroyed.",

It can change the color and texture of its tough, outward-facing side to help it blend in with its surroundings, while its soft, inward-facing side clings to the floor, wall, or ceiling in its hunting territory. It remains motionless as it waits for prey to come close. When a target is within its reach, it peels itself away from the surface and wraps around its prey, crushing, smothering, and then digesting it. Versatile Camouflage. A trapper can alter the color and texture of its outer side to match its surroundings. It can blend in with any surface made of stone, earth, or wood, masking its presence to any but the most rigorous scrutiny. It can't change its texture to that of a grassy or snow-covered surface, but it can change its color to match and then conceal itself under a thin layer of tation or actual snow. Stationary Hunters. A trapper needs to eat about a halfling-sized meal once a week to remain sated. It is content to stay in one place, given a steady supply of food, and thus trappers are a threat along any well-traveled dungeon corridor and on routes through the derness that see a lot of traffic. When prey is scarce, a trapper enters a state of hibernation \nthat can last for months, though it is still aware when prey comes near. A trapper on the verge of starvation might defy its instincts and begin creeping along, abandoning its old territory in search of better hunting. Beware of Leftovers. When its prey is dead, a trapper dissolves and absorbs the fleshy parts, leaving a ing of bones, metal, treasure, and other indigestible bits in the place where the creature had been. A trapper that lurks on the floor of its hunting grounds can cover these remains with own body, making them look like larities in the surface. The creature might also attach itself to a wall or a ceiling close to a recent kill, tively using the remnants as bait: a creature that stops to investigate the bones for valuables stands a good chance of becoming the trapper's next meal. ; e,: ¥ : -# s-: s;g.;  :± :4 :;; = := =  S5S 4 TRAPPER ",

Each vargouille carries a disease that creates more of its kind; a flock of vargouilles on the wing is a plague of chaos and evil waiting to happen. Abyssal Nuisances. Swarms of vargouilles flap through the caverns and skies of the Abyss. They are given little regard by powerful and intelligent demons since vargouilles can do them no harm. Even the weakest demon, such as a manes or a dretch, fears vargouilles only if they appear in great numbers. In the Lower Planes, vargouilles rarely get the chance to eat live prey other than vermin. More often, they lap up the ichor left behind when one fiend kills another. The World Awaits. Because of their instinctive ger for living prey, vargouilles are eager to escape the Lower Planes. On rare occasions, the summoning of a demon to another plane can bring a vargouille along for the ride, attaching itself like a tick. The precautions a mortal takes to contain and control a summoned demon rarely account for a stowaway, and thus a vargouille ters the world unbidden. Ghastly Reproduction. Vargouilles that roam free on the Material Plane are a dire threat to all creatures, pecially humanoids. Their awful shrieking can paralyze other creatures with fear, and such victims are helpless to resist a vargouille's accursed kiss. · The kiss of a vargouille infects a humanoid with a fiendish curse. If allowed to run its course, the curse brings about a gruesome transformation as an abyssal spirit invades the person's body. Over a period of hours, the victim's head takes on fiendish aspects such as fangs, tentacles, and horns. At the same time, the son's ears grow larger, expanding and transforming into wing-like appendages. In the final moments, the victim's head tears away from \nthe body in a fountain of blood, becoming another vargouille, which often then eagerly laps up its own life fluids. Sunlight or the brilliant nation of a daylight spell can delay this transformation, and vargouilles instinctively shun bright light as a result. VARGOUILLE ' CHAPTEJl 3",

        "flavorText": "VEGEPYGMIES Vegepygmies are fungus creatures that live in simple tribal units, hunting for sustenance and spreading the spores from which they reproduce. Primitive Plants. Vegepygmies, also called mold folk or moldies, inhabit dark areas that are warm and wet, so they are most commonly found underground or in dense forests where little sunlight penetrates. A vegepygmy instinctively feels kinship with other plant and fungus creatures, and thus vegepygmy tribes coexist well with creatures such as myconids, shriekers, and violet fungi. Although they prefer to eat fresh meat, bone, and blood, vegepygmies can absorb nutrients from soil and many sorts of organic matter, meaning that they rarely go hungry. A vegepygmy can hiss and make other noises by forcing air through its mouth, but it can't speak in a conventional sense. Among themselves, vegepygmies communicate by hissing, gestures, and rhythmic ping on the body. Vegepygmies build and craft little; any gear they have is acquired from other creatures or built by copying simple construction they have witnessed. RUSSET MOLD The fungus known as russet mold is reddish-brown in color and found only in places that are dark, warm, and wet. Russet mold that spreads out across a metal object can be mistaken for natural rust, and a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check is quired to identify it accurately by sight in such a case. Any creature that comes within 5 feet of russet mold must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw as the mold emits a puff of spores. On a failed save, the creature comes poisoned. While poisoned in this way, the creature takes 7 (2d6) poison damage at the start of each of its turns, sprouting moid as it takes damage. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Any magic that neutralizes poison or cures disease kills the infestation. A creature reduced to 0 hit points· by the mold's poison damage dies. If the dead creature is a beast, a giant, or a humanoid, one or more newborn vegepygmies emerge from its body 24 hours later: one newborn from a Small corpse1 two from a Medium corpse, four from a Large corpse; eight from a Huge corpse, or sixteen from a gantuan corpse. Russet mold can be hard to kill, since weapons and most types of damage do it no harm; Effects that deal acid, necrotic, or radiant damage kilt 1 square foot of russet mold per 1 damage dealt. A pound of salt, a gallon of hol. or a magical effect that cures disease kills russet mold in a square area that is 10 feet on a sjde; Sunlight kills any russet mold in the light's area. Mold Begets Mold. Vegepygmies originate from the remains left behind when a humanoid or a giant is killed by russet mold. One or more vegepygmies emerge from the corpse a day later. If a beast such as a dog or a bear dies from russet mold, the result is a bestial moldie called a thorny result instead of a humanoid-shaped vegepygmy. Thornies are less intelligent than mies, but have greater size and ferocity, as well as a thorn-covered body. As a vegepygmy ages, it grows tougher \nand develops spore clusters on its body. Spore-bearing vegepygmies are deferred to by other vegepygmies, so outsiders fer to such vegepygmies as chiefs. A chief can expel its spores in a burst, infecting nearby creatures. If a ture dies while infected, its corpse produces mies the same way russet mold does. No one knows for sure where russet mold came from. One historical account tells of adventurers in a ding mountain range discovering russet mold and pygmies in a peculiar metal dungeon full of str~nge life. Another story says that explorers found russet mold in a crater left by a falling star, with vegepygmies infesting the dense jungle nearby. VEGEPYGMY   SSi ; ; \n-&# :; :",

        "flavorText": "KI-RIN Ki-rins are noble, celestial creatures. In the Outer Planes, ki-rins in service to benevolent deities take a direct role in the eternal struggle between good and evil. In the mortal world, a ki-rin is celebrated far and wide as a harbinger of destiny, a guardian of the sacred, and a counterbalance to the forces of evil. Good Personified. Ki-rins are the embodiment of good, and simply beholding one can evoke fear or awe in an observer. A typical ki-rin looks like a muscular stag the size of an elephant, covered in golden scales lined in some places with golden fur. It has a dark gold mane and tail, coppery cloven hooves, and a spiral-shaped coppery horn just above and between its luminous violet eyes. In a breeze or when aloft, the creature's scales and hair can create the impression that the ki-rin is ablaze with a holy, golden fire. Beyond their coloration, ki-rins vary in appearance, based on the deity each one reveres and the function it typically performs in service to that god. Some are horse-shaped, looking like gigantic unicorns, and are often used as guardians. Others have draconic features and tend to be aggressive foes of evil. One horn is most common, but a ki-rin of fierce demeanor might have two horns or a set of antlers like those of a great stag. Brinsers of Boons. Common folk consider ki-rins to be rare and remote heralds of good fortune. Seeing a ki-KI-RIN rin fly overhead is a blessing, and events that happen on such a day are especially auspicious. If a ki-rin alights during a ceremony, such as a birth announcement or a coronation, everyone present understands that the creature is telling them great good could be in the offing. The ki-rin conveys its gifts and omens, then rises back into the sky. Ki-rins have also been known to appear at the sites of great battles to inspire and strengthen the side of good, or to rescue heroes from certain death. A ki-rin in the world claims a territory to watch over, and one ki-rin might safeguard an area that passes several nations. On other planes, ki-rins that serve good deities go wherever they are commanded, which could include coming to the Material Plane on a mission. A ki-rin disciple in the world usually serves its deity as a scout, a messenger, or a spy. Ki-rins are attracted to the worship of deities of courage, loyalty, selflessness, and truth, as well as the advancement of just societies. For instance, in Faerfin, ki-rins rally mostly to Torm, although ki-rins also serve his allies Tyr and Ilmater. O,Uects of Adoration. Because a ki-rin is renowned for its wisdom, other creatures would naturally seek it out with questions and requests if they could. For that reason among others, the creature makes its lair atop a forbidding mountain peak or in some other equally accessible location. Only those that have the tenacity to ",

Spawn ofYeenoshu. The first leucrottas came into being alongside the gnolls during Yeenoghu's rampages on the Material Plane. Some of the hyenas that ate noghu's kills went through different transformations rather than turning into gnolls. Among these bizarre results, leucrottas were the most numerous. As clever as it is cruel, a leucrotta loves to deceive, torture, and kill. Because leucrottas are smarter and tougher than most gnolls, one could occupy an elevated position within a gnoll tribe. Although a leucrotta is unlikely to lead a group of gnolls, it can influence the leader, and it might even agree to carry a leader into tle and offer advice during the fight. Gnolls see leucrottas as a form of entertainment, partly because a leucrotta can mimic the squeals of a suffering victim-a sound that always gives gnolls pleasure-even when no victims are to be had. Further, a gnoll is bloodthirsty and sadistic, but unable by its nature to prolong the fun of killing. Most leucrottas are consciously cruel, to the point of being meticulous about their savagery to draw out a kill into better and longer sport. Gnolls enjoy watching a leucrotta work almost as much as they like doing their own killing. Foulness Embodied. The leucrotta is so loathsome that only gnolls and others of its kind can stand to be around one for long. Its horrific, hodgepodge body oozes a foul stench that pollutes anywhere the creature lairs. This reek is outdone only by the creature's breath, which issues from a maw that drips fluid corrupted with rot and digestive juices. In place of fangs, a leucrotta has bony ridges as hard as steel that can crush bones and lacerate flesh. These plates are so tough that a leucrotta can use them to peel plate armor away from the body of a slain knight. A leucrotta's stench would normally warn away prey long before the creature could attack. It has two natural capabilities, however, that give it an vantage. First, a leucrotta's tracks are nearly impossible to distinguish from those of mon deer. Second, it can duplicate the call or the vocal expressions of just about any creature it has heard. The monster uses its mimicry to lure in potential victims, then attacks when they are confused or unaware of the actual threat. g-# .. -% < st5E¼Sd LEUCROTTA ",

Because of their magical hair and their mystical understanding of minerals, they are sought after by treasure-hunters, dwarves, and others that desire wealth beneath the earth. Earthy Fey. Korreds prefer to keep their own pany and occasionally consort with creatures of mental earth such as galeb duhr. A tribe of korreds gathers weekly to perform ceremonial dances, beating out rhythms on stone with their hooves and clubs. In the depths of the Material Plane, korreds typically flee from other creatures but become aggressive when they feel insulted or are annoyed by the sounds of mining. Stone Sympathy. No one knows the ways of stone and earth better than a korred. Korreds can seemingly smell veins of metal or gems. A korred on the surface can feel the rise and fall of bedrock under the earth and where caves lie, and underground it knows the ways through the stone for miles. Secret doors that lead through stone are as obvious as windows to a korred. Korreds can hurl boulders far larger than it seems they should be able to, shape stone as though it were clay, swim through rock, and summon earth tals and other creatures. They also gain supernatural strength just from standing on the ground. Enchanted Hair. Korreds have hair all over their ies, but the hair that grows from their heads is magical. When cut, it transforms into whatever material was used to cut it. Korreds use iron shears to cut lengths of their hair, then weave the strands together to create iron ropes that they can manipulate, animating them to bind or snake around creatures and objects. Korreds take great pride in their hair, and equally great offense at one who attempts to cut it without permission. KORRED  @ -? · I / bout a merchant ho .

Solitary Seekers. If separated from its illithid ters, a mindwitness seeks out other telepathic creatures to tell it what to do.

Orc priests that oversee the line between life and death are known by the others in the tribe as hands of Yurtrus. They dwell on the fringes of an ore lair, usually communing with other ores through the auspices of those who follow Luthic. The hands of Yurtrus wear pale gloves made of the bleached skin of other oids (preferably elves), symbolizing their connection with Yurtrus, and are sometimes called \"white hands\" as a result. Every ore knows that the hands ofYurtrus are the tribe's gateway to the ancestors. Ores who die having served the tribe well go on to rituals meant to send them to Gruumsh's realm. As befits followers of a god who doesn't speak, hands of Yurtrus remove their tongues to emulate their deity, for a reason similar to why an eye of Gruumsh puts out one of its eyes. 0RC NURTURED ONE OF YURTRUS When plague strikes a tribe, the hands of Yurtrus isolate the sick. The priest~ then minister to those who can be saved but not healed. The hands cultivate the sickness of these nurtured ones, turning them into instruments of defense and weapons of war. When ores go to battle, a band of nurtured ones might charge in first-to give themselves up while softening up the enemy by ing Yurtrus's vile blessing in its ranks. 0RC RED FANG OF SHARGAAS Shargaas is the ore deity of deep darkness and iness, a murderous god who hates anything that lives that isn't an ore. Ores consider Shargaas to be a divinity suited to pariahs and weaklings, all of them unfit for ORC RED FANG OF SHARGAAS . e-?tP?f? e :z+eces SP",

Evil humans who control ores also use such power to bolster their followers' strength. The demon lord Baphomet gladly shares the secret of creating tanarukks with those who entreat him for power. The process corrupts an unborn ore of the tribe, transforming it at birth into a creature much more age than an ore. Although tanarukks are fearsome fighters, they are a threat to their allies off the battlefield. Within the tribe's lair, a tanarukk is destructive and volatile, and best kept imprisoned. Sooner or later, a free tanarukk rampages through the tribe, attempting to take over by force. Most such coups fail, but at great cost to the tribe. If a tanarukk does seize the leadership of a tribe, reckless war is the course it inevitably chooses. If a tanarukk manages to breed, its blood taints merous subsequent generations, so its female dants randomly produce tanarukks. Rather than risk raising a natural-born tanarukk, most tribes slay such abominations. TANARUKK  Ed ...... f . --?e¥2: ¥&",

        "flavorText": "QUICKLING Quicklings rocket through haunting, twisted forests where the unseelie fey hold sway, both in the Feywild and in the world. Racing faster than the eye can track, each appears as little more than a blurry wavering in the air. A quickling is a small, slender fey, similar to a iature elf with sharp, feral features. Its cold, cruel eyes gleam like jewels. Live Fast, Die Youns. Quicklings owe their tence-and their plight-to the Queen of Air and ness, the dread ruler of the Gloaming Court. Once a race of lazy and egotistical fey, the creatures that would become the quicklings were late in answering the queen's summons one time too many. To hasten their pace and teach them to mind her will, the queen shrank their stature and sped up their intern'al clocks. The queen's curse gave quicklings their amazing speed but also accelerated their passage through life-no ling lives longer than fifteen years. Too Fast for Words. The mortal realm is a ponderous place to a quickling's eye: a hurricane creeps gradually across the sky, a torrent of rain drifts earthward like lazy snowflakes, lightning crawls in a meandering path from cloud to cloud. The slow and boring world seems to be populated by torpid creatures whose deep, mooing speech lacks meaning. To other creatures, a quickling seems blindingly fast, vanishing into an indistinct blur as it moves. Its cruel laughter is a burst of rapid staccato sounds, its speech a shrill squeal. Only when a quickling deliberately slows down, which it prefers not to do, can other beings erly see, hear, and comprehend it. Never truly at rest, a \"stationary\" quickling constantly paces and shifts in place, as though it can't wait to be off again. Mischief, Not Murder. Quicklings have a capricious nature that goes well with their energy level: they think as fast as they run, and they are always up to something. A quickling spends most of its time perpetrating acts of mischief on slower creatures. One rarely passes up an opportunity to tie a person's bootlaces together, move the stool a creature is about to sit on, or unbuckle a dle while no one's looking. Tricks of that sort are hardly the limit of their artful malice, however. They don't commit outright murder, but quicklings can ruin lives in plenty of other ways: stealing an important letter, swiping coins collected for the poor, planting a stolen item in someone's bag. lings enjoy causing suffering that transcends mere chief, especially when the blame for their actions falls on other creatures and creates discord.

Blood Lust Personified. In the Feywild, or where that plane touches the world at a fey crossing, if a sentient creature acts on an tense desire for bloodshed, one or more caps might appear where the blood of a slain person soaks the ground. At first, new caps look like tiny bloodstained mushrooms just pushing their caps out of the soil. When moonlight shines on one of these caps, a creature that looks like a wizened and dersized gnome with a hunched back and a sinewy frame springs from the earth. The creature has a pointed leather cap, pants of similar material, heavy iron boots, and a heavy bladed weapon. From the moment it awakens, a redcap desires only murder and carnage, and it sets out to satisfy these cravings. Redcaps lack subtlety. They live for direct tion and the mayhem of mortal combat. Even if a cap wanted to be stealthy, its iron boots force it to take ponderous, thunderous steps. When a redcap is near to potential prey, though, it can close the distance quickly and get in a vicious swing of its weapon before the get can react. Steeped in Slaughter. To sustain its unnatural tence, a redcap has to soak its hat in the fresh blood of its victims. When a redcap is born, its hat is coated with wet blood, and it knows that if the blood isn't ished at least once every three days, the redcap vanishes as if it had never been. A redcap's desire to slay is rooted in its will to survive. Bloodthirsty Mercenaries. Redcaps don't usually erate in groups, but in some circumstances they might be fond in the employ of hags and dark mages that know methods to call redcaps out of the Feywild and put them to work as grisly servants. Also, some redcaps can sense the being whose derous acts led to their birth. A redcap might use this innate connection to find its creator and make that ture its first victim. Others seek out their maker to enjoy proximity to a kindred spirit. An individual responsible for the creation of multiple redcaps at the same site could attract the entire group to serve as cohorts, lating that creature's murderous handiwork. In any case, if a redcap works with another being, the redcap demands to be paid in victims. A patron who tries to stifle a redcap's natural and necessary urge for blood risks becoming the redcap's next target. As aubtlit as a flun~ battleau. -Volo REDCAP ",

Even centuries after Kyuss's death, his mad disciples continue performing the horrific rites he perfected. Plague of Worms. From a distance or in poor light, a spawn of Kyuss looks like an ordinary zombie. As it comes into clearer view, one can see scores of little green worms crawling in and out of it. These worms jump onto nearby humanoids and burrow into their flesh. A worm that penetrates a humanoid body makes its way to the creature's brain. Once inside the brain, the worm kills its host and animates the corpse, transforming it into a spawn of Kyuss that breeds more worms. The dead humanoid's soul remains trapped inside the corpse, preventing the individual from being raised or resurrected until the undead body is destroyed. The ror of being a soul imprisoned in an undead body drives a spawn of Kyuss insane. Corruption Without End. Spawq of Kyuss are pressions of Orcus's intent to replace all life with death. Left to its own devices, a solitary spawn of Kyuss travels aimlessly. If it stumbles across a living creature, the spawn attacks with the sole intent of creating more spawn. Whether they are dispersed or clustered, spawn reproduce exponentially if nothing stops them. ",

MANO\\..I JU.C.MEMISTS, AR _ c\\..MINST£~ TLINCALLI Tlincallis, also called scorpion folk, are chitin-covered creatures, humanoid from the waist up with the lower body of an enormous scorpion, complete with a stinger at the end of a long tail. Desert Nomads. Tlincallis live austerely. They range across arid lands, hunting at dawn and dusk. In the hours between, they wait out the day's heat or the night's cold by burying themselves in loose sand or earth or, if the terrain proves too inflexible, lurking in ruins or shallow caves. A tribe of tlincallis stays in one place for only as long as the hunting is good in the mediate area, though they might visit the same way tions over and over during their wanderings. The tribe also settles down temporarily whenever it's time to lay eggs and hatch a new brood of young. Poisonous E;;s. Tlincallis deposit their eggs in warm places out of direct sunlight, often amid a stand of cacti near their present encampment. There the eggs lie tected by hard shells coated in paralytic poison similar to that produced by their stingers. A would-be predator that dares to break an egg is defenseless against the tlincallis that come to investigate. Horrid Kidnappers. Tlincallis eat what they kill, but they also take some of their prey alive when they have new mouths to feed. After using their stingers to paralyze victims and their spiked chains to bind them, tlincallis take these prisoners back to their encampment and tie them to cactus or rock formations. There, tims wait until the sun sets and the newly hatched young emerge from the lair to eat them alive. Prideful Hunters. Tlincallis see themselves as great hunters. If a tlincalli tribe encounters a more powerful hunter, such as a blue dragon, the tribe's leader must decide whether the group becomes obedient to the rior hunter, moves on, or fights to the death to defeat it. Makeshift Weapons and 01:uects. Tlincallis are civilized and don't build cities, make clothing, or mine metals. Instead, they scavenge what they need or want. They do, however, know how to melt down scavenged metal to forge crude weapons and tools. , .... * t·:. i72 ,..,--s,s 'TLINCALLI \n",

Born of Sacrifice. The ritual to create a wood woad is a primeval secret passed down through generations of savage societies and dark druid circles. Performing the ritual isn't necessarily an act of evil, if the victim-to-be has entered into a bargain that requires it to be a willing sacrifice. In the ritual a living person's chest is pierced and the heart removed. A seed is then pushed into the heart, and it is placed in a tree. Any hollow or crook will do, but ten a special cavity is carved out of the trunk. The tree is then bathed and watered with the blood of the sacrificed victim, and the body is buried among the tree's roots. ter three days, a sprout emerges from the ground at the base of the tree and swiftly grows into a humanoid form. This new body, armored in tough bark and bearing a gnarled club and shield, is at once ready to perform its duty. The one who performed the ritual sets the wood woad to its task, and the creature follows those orders unceasingly. Pitiless Protectors. A wood woad has a hole where its heart would be, just as does the body of its former self, buried in the earth. Those who become wood woads trade their free will and all sense of sentiment for supernatural strength and a deathless duty. They exist only to protect woodlands and the people who tend them. A wood woad's face is void and expressionless, except for the motes of light that swim about in its eye sockets. Wood woads speak little, and when not being called upon to take adion, they root themselves in the earth and silently take sustenance from it. Uprooted by Immortality. Like a tree, a wood woad needs only sunlight, air, and nutrients from the earth to go on living. Because they are undying, some wood woads outlive their original purpose. The site a wood woad guards might lose its power or significance over time, or those whom it was assigned to guard might themselves die. If it is freed from its specific duties, a wood woad might roam to find another place of natural beauty or fey influence to watch over. Wood woads are drawn to creatures that ha,ve close ties to nature, and that protect and respect the land, such as druids and treants. Some treants have wood woad servants by virtue of age-old pacts with druids or fey that performed the rituals, while others acquire the services of freed wood woads that find renewed purpose in the domain of a kindred guardian.  k  JJ!IIAf a>s&s +",

Each conquest brings new slaves and sacrifices, as well as glory and riches, that the anathema thinks it needs to achieve true divinity. An anathema's most loyal yuan-ti followers see it as the pinnacle of the serpentine form, an unbelievable improvement on the nearly perfect abomination. Its devoted human followers think of it as \"divine flesh in a mortal body,\" and cultists serving an anathema tend to be more bloodthirsty and self-sacrificing in its presence. Immortal. Anathemas don't age, allowing them to pursue their goals until the end of days. Truly powerful ones can grow to rule multiple yuan-ti cities and bring entire regions, including humanoid realms, under yuan-ti control. YUAN-TIBROODGUARD Broodguards are humanoids transformed by yuan-ti into simple-minded, scaly creatures that do their masters' bidding. The transformation process warps not only a subject's body but also its mind, making it instinctively obey any yuan-ti and filling it with a seething rage that rises at the sight of non-reptilian creatures. Although broodguards have low intelligence, they are able to perform simple yet important tasks in the community, such as guarding eggs or patrolling for truders. The yuan-ti refer to broodguards as \"histachii,\" which means \"egg-watchers.\" Human Na Mare. Most broodguards are made from human prisoners forced to consume a magical brew that renders them helpless and unable to fight off the table. A human transformed into a broodguard loses all semblance of who it once was, and even its human gin is barely discernible. A broodguard is hairless and emaciated, with yellow-green, scaly skin. It has beady, bloodshot eyes and a forked tongue, and smells faintly of rotting meat. Broodguards can speak but rarely do so, preferring to use snake-like hisses and guttural noises. YUAN-TI MIND WHISPERER Mind whisperers are malison spellcasters that enter into a pact with the serpent god Sseth, the Sibilant Death. They use their abilities to convert others to their faith, increase their personal power, and befuddle the minds of their enemies. A mind whisperer is elusive, manipulative, able, and willing to cheat or kill comrades and rivals alike if doing so benefits it.

On tiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the morkoth takes a lair action to cause one of the effects described below:  The morkoth uses its Hypnosis action, originating at a point within 120 feet of itself. It doesn't need to see the effect's point of origin.  The morkoth casts darkness, dispel magic, or misty step, using Intelligence as its spellcasting ability and without expending a spell slot. REGIONAL EFFECTS The island surrounding a morkoth's lair is warped by the creature's presence, creating the following effects:  The morkoth is aware of any new arrival, whether an object or a creature, on its island or in its sanctum. As an action, the morkoth can locate any one creature or object on the island. Visitors to the island feel as though they are being watched, even when they aren't.  Each time a creature that has been on the island for less than a year finishes a short or long rest, it must make a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check. On a failure, the creature has misplaced one possession (chosen by the player, if the creature is that player's character). The possession remains nearby but con-zu 5= 44 4&-t SES g cealed for a short time, so it can be recovered with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. An ject that is misplaced but not recovered ends up in the morkoth's lair 1 hour later. If the creature later goes to the morkoth's lair, its lost possessions stand out in its perception and are easily recovered. Entrances to the morkoth's lair have an enchantment that the morkoth can activate or suppress at any time while it's in its lair and not incapacitated. Any creature within 30 feet of such an entrance and able to see it must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature feels an intense urge to use its movement on each of its turns to enter the lair and to move toward the morkoth's location (the target doesn't realize it's heading toward a creature). The target moves toward the morkoth by the most direct route. As soon as it can see the morkoth, the target can peat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. It can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns and every time it takes damage.  With a thought (no action required), the morkoth can initiate a change in the water within its lair that takes effect 1 minute later. The water can be as breathable and clear as air, or it can be normal water (ranging in clarity from murky to clear). If the morkoth dies, these regional e:ff ects end immediately.",

The neogi has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, and magic can't put the neogi to sleep. Spider Climb. The neogi can climb difficult surfaces, ing upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. ACTIONS \nMultiattack. The neogi makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws. \nBite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the fect on itself on a success. Claws. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage. Enslave (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The neogi targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed by the neogi for 1 day, or until the neogi dies or is more than 1 mile from the target. The charmed target obeys the neogi's commands and can't take reactions, and the neogi and the target can communicate telepathically with each other at a distance of up to l mile. Whenever the charmed target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Outside the obligations of a servant to its master, neogi are willing to engage in any activity that profits them, and they are as devious as devils when doing so. Neogi buy and sell, but they pose a grave risk to tial patrons that might instead be easily enslaved, so their customers generally consist of desperate or evil individuals, or creatures that are formidable enough to treat with the neogi as equals. Neog~ traders might set up shop in a planar bazaar, on the edge of a drow city, or near a mind flayer enclave. In other locations, the natives are more likely to join together to destroy a neogi caravan than to allow it safe conduct and trading privileges. g; ;:-;-15#£. ... $ .... !El.... 9¥ NEOGI MASTER  e -:a",

To complement the various kinds of warriors that spill forth to ravage the countryside, each tribe has members that remain deep inside the lair, seldom if ever seeing what lies outside the darkness of their den. In addition, ores have special relationships with two creatures that are sometimes found in their company: the aurochs, a great bull that serves as a mount for warriors that revere Bahgtru, and the tanarukk, a demon-ore crossbreed that is so depraved and tive that even ores seek to kill it.
